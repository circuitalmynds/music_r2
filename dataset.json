Elle prend place, \u00e9crit Harry Halbreich, \u00ab aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des Sc\u00e8nes\nd\u2019enfants de Schumann et du Children\u2019s Corner de Debussy, parmi les musiques les plus\nravissantes jamais inspir\u00e9es par l\u2019enfance \u00bb. Les titres des pi\u00e8ces indiquent combien cette\nsuite fait allusion \u00e0 des situations ou \u00e0 des personnages familiers : la Berceuse avait\n\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite trente ans plus t\u00f4t pour une petite Suzanne, dont le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait pr\u00e9fet et ami de\nFaur\u00e9 ; Kitty (en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 Ketty) \u00e9tait le nom du chien des Bardac ; \u00ab Le jardin de Dolly \u00bb\nest une \u00ab promenade au jardin du Tendre \u00bb, selon Jean-Michel Nectoux, qui voit dans\n\u00ab Le pas espagnol \u00bb, l\u2019utime page du recueil, \u00ab un \u00e9blouissant hommage \u00e0 Espa\u00f1a de\nl\u2019ami Chabrier \u00bb; quant \u00e0 \u00ab Mi-a-ou \u00bb, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une allusion \u00e0 un chat mais \u00e0\n\u00ab Monsieur Raoul \u00bb, fr\u00e8re de Dolly (qu\u2019elle appelait \u00ab Aoul \u00bb).\n\n#GabrielFaure #OrchestreNationaldeFrance #Macelaru #Dolly\n\nC\u2019est Henri Rabaud (1873-1949) qui en assura l\u2019orchestration en 1905, \u00e9poque \u00e0\nlaquelle Massenet commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 trop souffrir de surdit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9m\u00ealer les timbres : \u00ab Ce\nque j\u2019entends le moins p\u00e9niblement, c\u2019est la voix chant\u00e9e. Mais l\u2019ensemble instrumental,\nc\u2019est le chaos et la douleur \u00bb, \u00e9crira-t-il quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard. Condisciple de Proust\nau lyc\u00e9e Condorcet, Rabaud avait \u00e9t\u00e9 notamment l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve de Massenet au Conservatoire\nde Paris avant d\u2019obtenir le Premier Grand Prix de Rome en 1894. Ironie de l\u2019histoire, il\nsucc\u00e9dera en 1920 \u00e0 Faur\u00e9 au poste de directeur du Conservatoire. Il signa pour Dolly\nune orchestration fort d\u00e9licate, dans laquelle Ravel devine \u00ab un tact et une souplesse des\nplus ing\u00e9nieux \u00bb. La pr\u00e9sence des trombones ne doit pas surprendre, car Rabaud les utilise\ndans leur couleur et leur nuance les plus douces (\u00e0 la fin de \u00ab Tendresse \u00bb par exemple).\nOn ne s\u2019\u00e9tonnera pas que le tambour de basque, dans \u00ab Le pas espagnol \u00bb, contribue \u00e0\nla couleur locale de la musique.\n\n00:00 - D\u00e9but du concert\n00:04 - Berceuse - Allegretto moderato (mi maggiore)\n03:05 - Mi-a-ou - Allegro vivo (fa maggiore)\n05:41 - Le jardin de Dolly - Andantino (mi maggiore)\n08:53 - Kitty-valse - Tempo di Valse (mi bemolle maggiore)\n12:14 - Tendresse - Andante (si bemolle minore) \n16:34 - Le pas espagnol - Allegro (re minore)\n\nOn pr\u00e9cisera que la suite Dolly fit l\u2019objet d\u2019une version dans\u00e9e qui fut cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1913 au\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre des arts, sur un livret de Louis Laloy et avec une chor\u00e9graphie de L\u00e9o Staats.",

        "description": "Hope you enjoy this live performance of Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 in E flat Major (with me as the soloist).  \n\nI love this concerto and find this concerto unique in several ways. The entire performance duration is on the quicker side, approximately twenty or sub-twenty minutes. The piece is a continuous composition in a way, aside from the pause between the first and the second movement. The entire concerto is pretty much based on the first theme we heard. Some says Liszt attached the \u201clyrics\u201d to the melody which pretty much translates as \u201cNone of you understand these, ha ha!\u201d\n\nThe concerto was premiered by Liszt as the soloist and Berlioz as the conductor.  This is an interesting matchup for the program, as this concerto shares much of the thematic transformation compositional technique with Berlioz\u2019s Symphonie Fantastique.  \n\nI really enjoyed many instances of the musical duets with other instruments in the first movement, the nocturne-like passages in the second, and definitely the fun triangle fairy tale-like vibe in the third.  And finally, the flying octaves at the ending, competing to be heard among the orchestra. It was definitely a great experience to fully enjoy performing this concerto with the orchestra.  \n\nPS. Apology for the brief audio cut in the fourth movement, this is the only recording I have of the performance, and for some reason, the audio track was split into two parts.  \n\nRecorded and performed at Hult Center for the Performing Arts, Eugene, Oregon, USA.  \n\nI. Allegro maestoso 0:00\n\nII. Quasi adagio 5:30\n\nIII. Allegretto vivace \u2013 Allegro animato 10:17\n\nIV. Allegro marziale animato 14:33\n\nThe score featured is from Edition Peters and is available on IMSLP on Public Domain. \n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Check out Liszt/Schumann Widmung here: https://youtu.be/u3DJqFT27hk \n\nIf you enjoy this video \ud83c\udfb5 please like and share! \n\n----------- \nSUBSCRIBE and turn on \ud83d\udd14 to be notified for more music! \ud83c\udfb9\n\n#liszt\n#piano\n#concerto\n#no1\n#lisztsolopianosheetmusic\n#pianoconcertoineflatmajor",

        "description": "\"Don't Go\" is a song by British synthpop band Yazoo (known as Yaz in America due to copyright reasons). It was released in July 1982 as the second single from their debut album, Upstairs at Eric's. Released in the UK in July 1982, the song peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Yazoo's second top 5 hit. In the US, where the band was known as Yaz, the song was their second big hit on the American dance chart, where it spent two weeks at number one in October 1982. Their first American dance chart hit was \"Situation\", which had also gone to number one on this chart earlier the same year. The music video for the song (not this clip) features band members Alison Moyet and Vince Clarke (Depeche Mode, erasure) in a sort of haunted mansion. The song is featured in the 1989 film Tango & Cash, in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories on the radio station Wave 103, and appears in Dance Dance Revolution II. The song re-entered the UK Dance Chart on 13 December 2009 at number 30, peaking at number 15 on 2 January 2010.\n\nwatch NINA HAGEN perform \"Ziggy Stardust\" live on swedish TV 1980: https://youtu.be/FDacp2NCOWM\n\nLyrics/paroles: \"Don't Go\"\n\nCame in from the city\nWalked into the door\nI turned around when I heard\nThe sound of footsteps on the floor\nLove just like addiction\nNow I'm hooked on you\nI need some time to get it right\nYour love's gonna see me through\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nOh, baby, make your mind up\nGive me what you got\nFix me with your lovin'\nShut the door and turn the lock\nHey, go get the doctor\nDoctor came too late\nAnother night, I feel all right\nMy love for you can't wait\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCame in from the city\nWalked into the door\nI turned around when I heard\nThe sound of footsteps on the floor\nSaid he was a killer\nNow I know it's true\nI'm dead when you walk out the door\nHey, babe, I'm hooked on you\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nCan't stop now, don't you know?\nI ain't never gonna let you go\nDon't go\n\nDon't go\nDon't go\nDon't go\nDon't go",

Thank you!\n\nPS1: The score is mine, i didn't get it from any page or sheet source, I've extracted it from the main melody so you might find some errors :)\n\nPS2: Please take a look to my new blog and feel free to download the content or leave a comment \nhttps://thefreewalzersheetspot.blogspot.com.co\n\nCredits to the picture's owners\n\nSheet music DL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4IWNd9CVCIGek5vRnV0WFpfWUk/view?usp=sharing\n\nMP3 DL: http://www.mediafire.com/file/t4zfvw35gdbcbdd/02._%C3%96sterreichische_Fahnenlieder%2C_op._317.mp3\n\nOriginal Carl Michael Ziehrer Orchestra\nHans Schadenbauer",

        "description": "You might remember the song from the movie \"The Shining\"\nRecorded February 16, 1934\nVictor Records 24700\nThe Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. The film is based on the novel of the same name, by Stephen King, about a writer with a wife and young son who accepts the job of an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel. The son, who possesses psychic abilities, is able to see things in the future and past, such as the ghosts in the hotel. Soon after moving in, and after a paralyzing winter storm that leaves the family snowed in, the father becomes influenced by the supernatural presence in the haunted hotel; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son. \n\nAlbert Allick Bowlly (7 January 1898 \u2013 17 April 1941) was a Mozambican-born South African/British vocalist and jazz guitarist who was popular during the 1930s in England. He recorded more than 1,000 songs.  \nHis most popular songs include \"Midnight, the Stars and You\", \"Goodnight, Sweetheart\", \"Close Your Eyes (Bernice Petkere song)\", \"The Very Thought of You\", \"Guilty\", \"Love Is the Sweetest Thing\" and the only English version of \"Dark Eyes\" by Adalgiso Ferraris as \"Black Eyes\" with words of Albert Mellor. \n\nOn 16 April 1941, Bowlly and Messene had given a performance at the Rex Cinema in Oxford Street, High Wycombe. Both were offered an overnight stay in town, but Bowlly took the last train home to his flat at 32 Duke Street, Duke's Court, St James, London. He was killed by a Luftwaffe parachute mine that detonated outside his flat at ten past three in the morning. His body appeared unmarked. Although the explosion had not disfigured him, it had blown his bedroom door off its hinges, and the impact against his head was fatal. He was buried with other bombing victims in a mass grave at Hanwell Cemetery, Uxbridge Road, Hanwell, where his name is given as Albert Alex Bowlly. \n\nMidnight with the stars and you\nMidnight and a rendez-vous\n\nYour eyes held a message tender\nSaying \"I surrender all my love to you\"\n\nMidnight brought us sweet romance\nI know all my whole life through\n\nI'll be remembering you\nWhatever else I do\n\nMidnight with the stars and you",
