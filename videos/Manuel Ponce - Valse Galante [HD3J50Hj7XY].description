It is me playing... could be better in those middle parts and some others... Oh well! Nice sounding waltz - I'm glad it was not a 'Melancholique' one (LOL!!!)

Manuel María Ponce Cuéllar (8 December 1882 – 24 April 1948) was a Mexican composer active in the 20th century. His work as a composer, music educator and scholar of Mexican music connected the concert scene with a mostly forgotten tradition of popular song and Mexican folklore. Many of his compositions are strongly influenced by the harmonies and form of traditional songs.
