Cziffra's first recording of Chopin's Waltzes. Cziffra plays the Waltzes as miniature tone poems - the faster tempo Waltzes are scintillating and brilliant while the slower ones have that familiar tears behind the smile or bitter sweet quality so typical of Chopin.  Cziffra performed and recorded many of Chopin's works including the Etudes Op.10 & 25, Polonaises, Sonatas No.2 & 3, Ballade No.4 and the first Piano Concerto etc. bringing to them his very personal unique style.
